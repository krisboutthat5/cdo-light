1- identified IBuffer as a concept to be changed/adapted in order to avoid marshaling to bytes array. Method  ByteBuffer IBuffer.startPutting(long  channelID), this method needs to be "replaced" by a new semantic to transfer objects through IChannel. 

2- Direct instance transfer is not possible because of client/server state interdependency i.e., there needs to be two instances of the same object.


3- Task
  - Need to find out a strategy for optimized "non marshaled" object from client to server.
